        <h3 className="font-display text-base font-semibold">1. Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          MeatLens is an academic research and decision-support system developed as part of an undergraduate Computer Science thesis project. The platform utilizes artificial intelligence, computer vision, and machine learning technologies to assist in detecting possible meat spoilage through image analysis.
        </p>
        <p>The system is intended strictly for: academic research, educational purposes, prototype demonstration, and decision-support assistance.</p>
        <p>MeatLens does not replace professional food safety inspections, laboratory testing, regulatory evaluations, or official food safety certifications. All AI-generated outputs should be treated as recommendations only.</p>
      </section>

      <section className="space-y-2">
        <h3 className="font-display text-base font-semibold">2. Information Collected</h3>
        <p><strong>Uploaded Images:</strong> Users may upload meat product images, inspection-related photographs, and sample datasets for evaluation and testing. These images are processed by AI models for spoilage detection and analysis.</p>
        <p><strong>User Information:</strong> If authentication and account management features are enabled, the system may collect full name, email address, institutional role, and login credentials (secured using encryption or hashing methods).</p>
        <p><strong>Device and Usage Information:</strong> The system may automatically collect browser information, device type, IP address, access timestamps, error logs, and system activity records.</p>
        <p><strong>Research and Dataset Information:</strong> Images, metadata, annotations, and analytical results used for model training, validation, performance testing, research documentation, and academic evaluation may be securely stored for thesis and research purposes.</p>
